# Gmail QuickOpen Firefox Addon

## Description
Gmail QuickOpen is a Firefox addon that allows you to quickly open your Gmail e-mails with a single click. This addon is designed to save you time and is a workaround to the removal of the double-click to open in a new Gmail window (replaced by Google with “SHIFT + CLICK”)..
It adds an "Open" button on the list of messages allowing you to open your messages in another window.
Other options allow you to remove "Alerts" ("Conversation placed in ..." etc.), display e-mail on a maximized window...
