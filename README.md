# Gmail QuickOpen Firefox Addon

## Description
Gmail QuickOpen is a Firefox addon that allows you to quickly open your Gmail emails in another window with a single click. This addon is designed to save you time and is a workaround to the removal of the double-click to open in a new Gmail window (replaced by Google with “SHIFT + CLICK”)..
It adds an "Open" button on the list of messages allowing you to open your messages in another window.
Other options allow you to remove some "Alerts" ("Conversation placed in ..." etc.), display email on a maximized window...

## Features
- One-Click open an email in another window
- Remove Gmail alerts
- Lightweight and fast
- Easy to install and use

## Usage
1. After installation, you will see a Gmail icon in your Firefox toolbar to manage options.
2. The "Open" button is displayed in the list of messages (at the end of the toolbar, displayed on hover).
